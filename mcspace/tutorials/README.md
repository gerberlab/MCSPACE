# Tutorials

The MCSPACE pipeline consists of three main steps: data preparation, inference, and result visualization. Here we provide tutorials for performing each step.

- [Tutorial 1: data preparation](./data_preprocessing.ipynb): This tutorial goes over how to format input data for the MCSPACE model and how to prepare data for model inference.
- [Tutorial 2: running inference](./running_inference.ipynb): This tutorial goes over how to perform model inference given preprocessed SAMPL-seq data.
- [Tutorial 3: visualization results](./visualizating_results.ipynb): This tutorial goes over how to visualize the results of model inference. It covers options for visualizing assemblages, assemblage proportions, and association networks over time.

Additionally, see the [user's manual](../docs/README.md) for more information on the MCSPACE software.
