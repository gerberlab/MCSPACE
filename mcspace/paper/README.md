# MCSPACE paper

## Instructions
For detailed instructions on each step of the analysis, please refer to the primary internal README: [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md)

As noted in that document, all scripts must be executed from within the `scripts` directory. This ensures proper relative pathing to the root `scripts/settings.sh` environment file, from which all other paths are defined.

After completing the main analysis by running scripts in the `scripts` directory, you can generate figures of the results using the Jupyter notebook scripts in the `figures` directory.
